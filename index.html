                  I made this immediately after my hangman game, with my main goal being to make an "AI" to play against.
                  The result was that the code became very confusing and the AI's logic has been lost forever.

                  Smart Parking aims to reduce congestion caused by circling drivers by helping them find parking quicker.
                  This is a prototpye of a mobile app for a Smart Parking System which uses sensors in parking spaces to detect
                  whether it is occupied or not. The system allows for drivers to search and view available parking spaces.

                  The Travelling Thief problem is a combination of the Travelling Salesman and Knapsack problem.
                  A thief has to find the optimal route to take and which items to steal along the way  - having
                  to deal with the weight along the way. The provided paper was the basis for our solution to the
                  problem.
